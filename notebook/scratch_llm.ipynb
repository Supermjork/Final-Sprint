    "In the above mentioned description of the data, there exists aspects that need removal, explanation will follow within this cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removal of id: Due to the nature of what this project is about, and usually a general case, IDs are not usually if at all used to gain insights from data, due to them being unique per entry and being nothing but an enumeration of entries.\n",
    "- Cleaning within `comment_text`: Cleaning the comments will be separated into $x$ steps, namely:\n",
    "    - Space and Tab removal: Removing of Newline Characters (`\\n`) and Tabs (`\\t`) will help remove special characters from text and avoiding noise within.\n",
    "    - Uppercase: Due to standarisations within the NLP field, it has been agreed upon to change any uppercase letter into lowercase, to mitigate the face that words can be written using multiple permutations of the same letters but with different cases, so in order to for the machine to recognise the word and not have to account for $n^{52}$ different combinations for the word (Where $n$ is number of characters to represent a word, and $52$ is due to both upper and lower cases of a letter)\n",
    "    - URL: Removal of URLs will prove beneficial, as it doesn't contribute much to the corpus nor is considered a baseline for labelling the comment.\n",
    "    - IP Address: For security reasons.\n",
    "    - Special Characters: Due to the non-existence of any in the Latin Alphabet which English uses, it would be useless to bother with them, although if this was a multi-lingual dataset, some characters from different languages would be needed to keep.\n",
    "- Derivatives of `toxic`: For purposes of simplicity, I have decided to *\"collapse\"* the values that follow after the *`toxic`* column, as in summing the values into said column, then swapping values $>1$ to be just $1$ to indicate toxicity, implying that $0$ would be for non-toxic comments; as a result, this will water down into just a \"Binary Classification\" problem based on words."
